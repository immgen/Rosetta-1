Dataset,Description
CD45pos Splenocytes panel1,"Whole CD45+ mouse splenocytes, from a 6 wo B6 male, sorted by flow cytometry. CITEseq encapsulation was done on a 10XGenomics instrument, with a 97-Ab panel of 97 TotalSeqC reagents Library construction with a Chromium Single Cell 5' Library Kit. 8294 cells passing QC shown here. In the UMAP/Heatmap viewer, cell and cluster coloring according to seurat clusters or lineage call made by singleR and manual marker curation."
